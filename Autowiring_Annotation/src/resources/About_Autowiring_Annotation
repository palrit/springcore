@Autowire annotation use byType. byType causes ambiguity
to resolve it in annotation basis we use @qualifier along with @Autowire
in qualifier we pass requires bean id @Qualifier("e1")
to activate these two annotations, need to instanciate one class autowireAnnotaion beanPostProcessor

In Annotation based configuration there is no need to write setters and constructors, automatically it will inject dependency by reading private members of the class
